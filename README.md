# MeterVideo2Txt

## Work in Progress!!

## Introduction
Logs digital meter readings from standalone devices from video. 

All you need is to record a video of your reading.

This project will convert video of oximetry readings into logs as a use case.
Internally, it relies on pretrained AI for OCR based on the library [MMOCR](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr).
